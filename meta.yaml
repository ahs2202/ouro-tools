  summary: A comprehensive toolkit for quality control and analysis of single-cell long-read RNA-seq data
  description: |
    Ouro-Tools is a novel, comprehensive computational pipeline for long-read scRNA-seq with the following key features. Ouro-Tools (1) normalizes mRNA size distributions and (2) detects mRNA 7-methylguanosine caps to integrate multiple single-cell long-read RNA-sequencing experiments across modalities and characterize full-length transcripts, respectively.
